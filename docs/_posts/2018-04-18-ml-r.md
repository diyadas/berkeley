## About Nima and Jeremy

[Nima](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/~nhejazi/) is a PhD student in the
[Group in Biostatistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/biostat/), where he is
jointly supervised by [Mark van der Laan](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/~laan)
and [Alan Hubbard](https://hubbard.berkeley.edu). Nima is also affiliated with
the [UC Berkeley NIH Biomedical Big Data training
program](http://bbd.berkeley.edu/) and the [Center for Computational
Biology](http://ccb.berkeley.edu/). Currently, his research centers around
nonparametric statistical and causal inference, machine learning, and
statistical computing -- focusing on the development of robust techniques for
inference and estimation in an eclectic collection of problem settings, with
applications often arising in precision medicine, vaccine efficacy trials,
computational biology, and public policy.

Jeremy is a recent PhD graduate in Biostatistics who continues working with the
department to translate statistical theory to software. During his PhD studies,
Jeremy worked with [Alan Hubbard](https://hubbard.berkeley.edu) and [Mark van
der Laan](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/~laan) on a series of projects broadly
related to computational statistics, including more efficient cross-validation
routines for ensemble machine learning and a software framework for
cross-validation ([`origami`](https://origami.tlverse.org)). His current
research interests include causal inference, model selection, re-sampling
techniques, statistical software development, and statistical methods for
assessing time series data from sensor systems.

## Machine Learning Pipelines for R with `sl3`

We present [`sl3`](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3), a recently developed
software package for the [R language and environment for statistical
computing](https://www.r-project.org), designed to provide utilities for
engaging in a host of common machine learning tasks. Topics to be addressed
include efficient data organization and accession, the construction of pipelines
for data munging and analysis (based on the idea popularized by Python's
[`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)),
and methods for performing ensemble machine learning (e.g., optimal stacked
regressions). [`sl3`](https://sl3.tlverse.org) is a core part of the
[`tlverse`](https://tlverse.org), a new ecosystem of software packages currently
being developed by a team in the [Group in
Biostatistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/biostat/) here at Berkeley.
