# d3_simplemap

D3 tutorial for making a [map](https://bl.ocks.org/cypranowska/b17359016fd22b81914fd2031cb301f0) with data on US campgrounds from recreation.gov.

# Intro to D3

## How to prepare for this tutorial

1. [Download an install Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
    *(This is my preferred tool for building visualizations with D3, but isn't strictly necessary. It has a nice live preview function that serves the page to your browser. Other options include using node.js)
2. Fork or download the repository with the data (link coming soon)
    *It has a template in the main directory that we'll use to write our code, our raw data in a .csv file in the /data directory
    
## So what is D3?

Data-driven Documents, better known as D3, is a JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations for the web. Mike Bostock, the primary developer of D3, first [published](http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2011-D3-InfoVis.pdf) D3 in 2011, and it's been a favorite data visualization tool.

However, D3 has a reputation for being a challenging library to master. This is because it requires knowledge of how SVG works, a bit about HTML/CSS, and a large dose of JavaScript. The goal of this workshop is to help you get a good enough sense of how D3 works so that you can try things on your own!

## Going in (SVG) circles

D3 visualizations usually begin with creating SVG objects. So let's create 3 circles using SVG.

```HTML
<svg width="720" height="120">
    <circle cx ="40" cy="60" r="10"></circle>
    <circle cx ="80" cy="60" r="10"></circle>
    <circle cx ="120" cy="60" r="10"></circle>
</svg>
```

D3 allows you to select elements and then manipulate them. Let's change the color of the circles to `steelblue` and the radius to 30.

```javascript
var circle = d3.selectAll("circle");
circle.style("fill", "steelblue");
circle.attr("r",30);
```

Now if you inspect the circles in your browser, the SVG markup should look like this:

```HTML
<svg width="720" height="120">
    <circle cx ="40" cy="60" r="30" style="fill:steelblue;"></circle>
    <circle cx ="80" cy="60" r="30" style="fill:steelblue;"></circle>
    <circle cx ="120" cy="60" r="30" style="fill:steelblue;"></circle>
</svg>
```

Instead of passing a string or an integer to a .style or .attr call, you can also pass a function. Try adding this line to your javascript code. What do you think the result would be?

```javascript
circle.attr("cx",function () { return Math.random()*720 });
```

Inspect the circles again in your browser. Now the `cx` parameter should be changing with each page refresh.

## Binding data to HTML or SVG elements is the foundation of D3

How do I change the attributes of my SVG elements based on my data? The first step is to bind the data to the SVG elements. In the javascript portion of our document, delete the `circle.attr("r",30)` line and add the following:

```javascript
circle.data([32,57,112]);
circle.attr("r", function(d) { return Math.sqrt(d); });
```

Here `d` refers to the data we bound to the circles. Open the web inspector and run `console.log(d3.selectAll("circle"))`. Each element should have a `__data__` parameter, and that value should correspond to the data value. 

We can also pass the index of elements that are selected. After removing the `circle.attr("cx", ...)` line, add the following:

```javascript
circle.attr("cx", function(d, i) {  return i * 100 + 30; });
```
Now the x location of each circle is a function of its index!

## But what if I had 1000000000000000 rows of data!!!

With D3 you don't need to explicitly write out every SVG element you want for your final data visualization. What you can do is make a virtual selection with D3, bind your data to it, and then create the elements that you want on the page. THIS is the magic of D3. 

Go ahead, and delete the `<circle>` elements from the SVG portion of your document. The javascript portion should look like this:

```javascript
/* create an svg canvas, 300 by 100 px */
var svgCanvas = d3.select("body").append("svg")
                  .attr("width", 300)
                  .attr("height, 100);

/* the data */
var dat = [32,57,112,293];

/* select circles virtually, bind the data, add attributes */
svgCanvas.selectAll("circle")
    .data(dat)
    .enter()
    .append("circle")
    .attr("cy", 60)
    .attr("cx", function (d, i) }{ return i * 100 + 30;})
    .attr("r", function (d) { return Math.sqrt(d); });
```
Appending to the virtual selection allows us to create circles for each data point, even if we don't have those circles already drawn on the canvas.

# You don't need to reinvent the wheel
