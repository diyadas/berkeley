Instead of our typical THW lesson format, this week we will be having a joint event with the [Graduate Data Science Organization](https://gdso.berkeley.edu/index.html). As always, everyone is welcome to join, even if you're not a graduate student or affiliated with UC-Berkeley. 

The GDSO is a student led organization with the purpose of providing graduate students and postdoc fellows with resources to explore career opportunities in data science. In order to continue building connections between members on campus, weâ€™ll be hosting monthly meetups for all of you interested in data science. These meetups will be informal and feature a few short talks about a variety of topics relevant to our organization. They will happen on the second Wednesday of every month at BIDS. Sign up for the GDSO mailing list or contact the organizers directly at officers@gdso.berkeley.edu.
